# Project Statement  
## Task Manager – Productivity Enhancement Tool

### 1. Problem Definition
Students and working individuals often struggle with managing multiple tasks, deadlines, and priorities. Without a structured system, tasks may be forgotten, delayed, or completed inefficiently. This leads to reduced productivity, increased stress, and poor time management.

### 2. Objective of the Project
The objective of this project is to build a simple yet effective Python-based Task Manager application that helps users:
- Organize their daily tasks  
- Track deadlines  
- Mark progress  
- Identify overdue and upcoming tasks  
- Improve overall productivity  

### 3. Scope of the Project
This application is designed as a command-line tool suitable for students and beginners learning Python. The project focuses on:
- Basic file handling  
- Modular programming  
- Using functions effectively  
- Handling dates with the datetime module  
- Applying top-down design and structured development  

### 4. Features Implemented
- Add new tasks with title, description, deadline  
- Edit task details  
- Delete tasks  
- Mark tasks as completed  
- Store tasks persistently in a JSON file  
- View all tasks in a clean list  
- Generate productivity summary (total, completed, pending)  
- Detect overdue tasks  
- Detect upcoming tasks  

### 5. Tools & Technologies Used
- *Python Programming Language*  
- *JSON* for permanent storage  
- *datetime module* for deadline comparison  
- Text-based user interface  

### 6. Methodology / Development Process
- Problem Definition  
- Requirement Analysis  
- Modular Design (main, storage, analytics)  
- Algorithm Development  
- Coding and Implementation  
- Testing & Refinement  

### 7. Expected Outcome
A functional task-management console application that helps users stay organized, meet deadlines, and be more productive in their daily activities.

### 8. Conclusion
This project demonstrates the use of Python fundamentals to solve a real-world productivity problem. The Task Manager is simple, effective, and serves as a practical application of concepts like functions, file handling, modularization, and date management.
